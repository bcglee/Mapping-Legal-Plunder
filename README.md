We began our final project by brainstorming different possible visualizations, speaking with our collaborator, Gabrel Pizzorno, and consulting D3 examples online.  This enabled us to determine what would be most useful to our collaborator, as well as what would be feasible for our final project.  In particular,

We began our coding by reproducing our A3 submission (which we made in Vega-Lite) using D3.  Because we were all new to D3 (and front-end development in general), this proved to be a great learning experience, as well as a challenge.  To do so, we first made a map visualization with dots showing the towns, then added zooming to the map and created a static timeline, then enabled brushing on the timeline, which we linked with the map.  We then added the object category histogram and added interactivity via selection on the bars.  We then added 2D brushing on the map.  We enabled the 3 modes of interactivity (timeline brushing, map brushing, and object category selection) in 3 different copies of our visualization.  We then combined these 3 views into one visualization with cross-filtering enabled.  This took significant refactoring in our codebase.  We opted to get rid of brushing on the map, as there was a lot of latency, and instead opted for the town list for selections.  We then added tooltips with the total and selected numbers for towns and for the object cateogry histogram.  We then added the item list that dynamically updates with filtering.  

Concurrent to all of this, we created the animation of wealth flow.  We als oexperimented with the social network data in our dataset (the social network of creditors, debtors, and plunderers), but we found that the graph did not seem to be sufficiently rich to be worth our while in producing a polished visualization, so we opted against pursuing it further.  We also spent a significant amount of time experimenting with different map backgrounds (geoJSONs, topoJSONs, shapefiles, etc.), which proved to be more difficult than we anticipated so we continued to use the map that we had used for A3.  

In terms of a breakdown of who contributed what, it is quite difficult for us to disentangle who did what, as our development process entailed us working together in person, as well as remotely.  For example, Ashrujit got the first brush interaction working on the timeline, Ben made it run faster, and Tim styled it.  Our project is replete with examples such as these.  All four of us believe that we divided the work well, and we are quite proud of what we have accomplished!
